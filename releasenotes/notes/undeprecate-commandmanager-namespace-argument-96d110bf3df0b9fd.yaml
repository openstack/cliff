    The ``namespace`` argument to ``cliff.commandmanager.CommandManager`` is
    no longer deprecated for removal. Users should still prefer invoking
    ``load_commands`` instead and the argument remains optional, but for
    simpler use cases the following will continue to work::

        cm = commandmanager.CommandManager('foo')
