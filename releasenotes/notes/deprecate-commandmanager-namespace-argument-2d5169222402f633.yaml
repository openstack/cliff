deprecations:
  - |
    The ``namespace`` argument to ``cliff.commandmanager.CommandManager`` has
    been deprecated for removal. Users should prefer invoking ``load_commands``
    instead. For example, instead of::

        cm = commandmanager.CommandManager('foo')

    Do::

        cm = commandmanager.CommandManager()
        cm.load_plugins('foo')
