features:
  - |
    ``cliff.commandmanager.CommandManager`` now accepts an optional
    ``ignored_modules`` argument, which can be used to indicate modules that
    should be skipped when loading commands. This can be useful if e.g. moving
    a command from a plugin to the core application, to ensure the version in
    the core application is always preferred.
upgrade:
  - |
    cliff will now warn if duplicates command implementations are found, rather
    than silently ignoring them.
